## Publications & Projects

### Building Baseline Models with Design Patterns in ML (Part 1)
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048](https://medium.com/@tabers77/building-baseline-models-with-design-patterns-in-ml-part-1-1b85b8dcc6cb))

This article delves into the art of developing baseline models for machine learning projects by leveraging design patterns. With a particular emphasis on enhancing code organization and usability, the author discusses a range of versatile patterns—including configurations, decorators, factory pattern, builder pattern, and template pattern—and explains how they contribute to superior code quality.
