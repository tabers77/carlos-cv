### Selfly Store
*June 2022 - June 2023*

#### Introduction:
In my role on the Selfly Store project, I leveraged AI to enhance the intelligence of vending machines, making them AI-driven and improving the overall shopping experience.

#### Patentable Solution:
The innovative AI solution developed in this project is poised to be patentable, with a patent currently in the process of being filed in the US.

#### Project Stages:

**Analytics/Engineering Stage:**
- Managed and processed extensive cloud-stored data.
- Designed a preprocessing pipeline for crucial product inventory in JSON files.
- Used algorithms like DFS to compress the dataset for analytics.
- Improved product categorization with a logic-based approach and addressed uncategorized products using a TF-IDF-based classifier.
- Created a cabinet lifetime value model, treating cabinets as customers for performance assessment with CLV scores.

**Artificial Intelligence Stage:**
- Implemented forecasting using LSTM models and ensemble methods for accurate predictions.
- Developed deep neural network-based models for propensity score.
- Built collaborative filtering and hybrid systems for personalized recommendations in recommender systems.
- Utilized Bayesian statistics to optimize prices for increased revenue and customer satisfaction in dynamic pricing.
