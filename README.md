## Projects

### AI Acceleration with Generative AI
*January 2024 - Present*

In the AI Acceleration with Generative AI project, I played a pivotal role in democratizing generative AI capabilities throughout the company. Key contributions include:
- Orchestrating chatbots with a combination of closed and open-source tools.
- Utilizing Hugging Face, Lanchain, and Streamlit for UI enhancements.
- Seamlessly integrating deployed chatbots into Azure Cloud for scalability and flexibility.
- Advancing the company's AI capabilities, fostering innovation, and improving operational efficiency.

### Precision Forestry
*August 2023 - December 2023*

In the Precision Forestry project, I focused on optimizing code structure through the implementation of design patterns. Key achievements include:
- Refactoring regression models and constructing baseline models with Azure AutoML SDK.
- Streamlining the development process and improving overall codebase efficiency.

### Selfly Store
*June 2022 - June 2023*

#### Introduction:
In my role on the Selfly Store project, I leveraged AI to enhance the intelligence of vending machines, making them AI-driven and improving the overall shopping experience.

#### Patentable Solution:
The innovative AI solution developed in this project is poised to be patentable, with a patent currently in the process of being filed in the US.

#### Project Stages:

**Analytics/Engineering Stage:**
- Managed and processed extensive cloud-stored data.
- Designed a preprocessing pipeline for crucial product inventory in JSON files.
- Used algorithms like DFS to compress the dataset for analytics.
- Improved product categorization with a logic-based approach and addressed uncategorized products using a TF-IDF-based classifier.
- Created a cabinet lifetime value model, treating cabinets as customers for performance assessment with CLV scores.

**Artificial Intelligence Stage:**
- Implemented forecasting using LSTM models and ensemble methods for accurate predictions.
- Developed deep neural network-based models for propensity score.
- Built collaborative filtering and hybrid systems for personalized recommendations in recommender systems.
- Utilized Bayesian statistics to optimize prices for increased revenue and customer satisfaction in dynamic pricing.
